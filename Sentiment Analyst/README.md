### LET'S TALK ABOUT SENTIMENT ANALYSIS <br />
Automatically identifying the affective states of text is the process of sentiment analysis, a crucial area of natural language processing. Sentiment analysis is frequently used in customer-generated content, including social network posts, product reviews on websites like Amazon, and reviews of movies. It may be as simple as categorizing a text's polarity as positive or negative, or it may involve more complex tasks like examining sentiment states. <br />

Sentiment analysis refers to analyzing an opinion or feelings about something using data like text or images, regarding almost anything. Sentiment analysis helps companies in their decision-making process. For instance, if public sentiment towards a product is not so good, a company may try to modify the product or stop the production altogether in order to avoid any losses. <br />

There are many sources of public sentiment e.g. public interviews, opinion polls, surveys, etc. However, with more and more people joining social media platforms, websites like Facebook and Twitter can be parsed for public sentiment. <br />
