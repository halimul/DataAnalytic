# Visualization of Covid 19 Case Data across Provinces in Indonesia 
## Background
To provide insight for the government in decision-making appropriate to anticipate covid 19 cases in Indonesian provinces, it is required to create a visualization of the number of covid cases in provinces in Indonesia.

I will present a few visualizations of the time series dataset. There are 5 things that will be visualized in this project:

1. Top 5 provinces with the most number of Cases 
2. Top 5 provinces with the most number of Deaths
3. Top 5 Province with the most recovery
4. The Number of new cases in DKI Jakarta from 3 Jan 2020 - 7 Sep 2021
5. The Number of Deaths in DKI Jakarta from 3 Jan 2020 - 7 Sep 2021
6. Comparison of new Covid Cases, Deaths and Recovery in Jakarta 

Based on the results of the insights obtained, visualization will be carried out so that they can be easily understood.

The data used in this project consists of 38 columns and 21759 rows. Data can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vt_U_JHxu7YoPCrbHtHmXK53XNy9Rg53/view?usp=sharing). 

## Stages
The project will go through several stages as follows:  
1. Load data:  load data from source

3. Visualization: Visualization and analysis of the visualization through the three things above
